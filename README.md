# Rick and Morty UI

This project implements a user interface for the Rick and Morty [API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation), using Reactjs (Typescript, ReduxToolkit, Hooks), and Axios.

It's as an experimental project to test the brillian work of [evanw](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) on [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/), although primarily used as a webpack loader, since opted to use Webpack dev server for [HMR](https://webpack.js.org/guides/hot-module-replacement/), as otherwise it'd require some extra work.

Also, a test-drive for Tailwindcss, used in the project by css class composition.
